1. i used spread filter in noise. The Spread filter swaps each pixel in the active layer or selection with another randomly chosen pixel by a user specified amount. 
Also i used cartoon filter in artistic. The Cartoon filter modifies the active layer or selection so that it looks like a cartoon drawing. Its result is similar to a black felt pen drawing subsequently shaded with color. This is achieved by darkening areas that are already distinctly darker than their neighborhood.

2. The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

4.i think it is easy to stwich from xhtml to html5.
We only need to change a few tags or elements to pass html5 validation. For examples, first of all we need to change the doctype and encoding information. For content, we only need to make some div tags to semantic elements such as header, footer and section.
